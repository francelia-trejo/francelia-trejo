# Do You Mean Real Pandas?

Unfortunatly no, but that would make R and Python exponentially cooler. As it turns out, although R and Python are completely different languages, YOU have the power to instantly add Python to your chunk of R code. Once you are able to do that, then you can start using things like panda and be able to manipulate your data hopefuly more efficently (double the languages!). 

## Showing off using R and Python Together

Being able to use Python and R in R Studio is as easy as installing a package called reticulate. Just run it from your library and bam, you are good to go. 

```{r}
library(reticulate)
```

## What is Pandas?

Now, we are able to import pandas in a Python. This will alos you to manipulate your datasets and ais in analysis. Functions like print will show your dataset, and .shape to see that there are a 1000 rows and 5 variables in the 'quakes' dataset. All of the different functions just make everything clearer and easier to handle. 

```{python}
import pandas as pd
quakes=pd.read_csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/quakes.csv",index_col=0)

print(quakes[:10])
quakes.shape
```

Make sure to give this a try and tell me how your experience with Pything in R Studio and Pandas was!!
