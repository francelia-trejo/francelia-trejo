# Do You Mean Real Pandas?

Unfortunatly no, but that would make R and Python exponentially cooler. 

## Showing off using R and Python Together

```{r}
library(reticulate)
```

## What is Pandas?

```{python}
import pandas as pd
quakes=pd.read_csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/quakes.csv",index_col=0)

print(quakes[:10])
quakes.shape
```
